<h2>USING FT2232H AS SYNCHRONOUS DIGITAL OUTPUT</h2>
<p>
I was looking for a solution that could generate digital outputs meeting below conditions:
<ul>
  <li>Pins that are synchronous.</li>
  <li>At least 4 IO pins.</li>
  <li>USB.</li>
  <li>Have Python wrappers or packages.</li>
</ul>
<p>
In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
<p>
You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
Just write inside an HTML file directly! 
So much simpler.
<p>
You can <a href="nextpage.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
<p>
Or insert an image like this:

<p>
That's it!

<h3>DIGITAL OUTPUT WITH MPSSE</h3>
<pre>var foo = "bar";
var hello = "world";
console.log(foo);
console.log(hello);</pre>
<h3>DIGITAL OUTPUT WITH SYNCHRONOUS BITBANG</h3>
<h3>REFERENCE</h3>
