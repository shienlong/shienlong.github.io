<h2>JTAG USING FT2232H</h2>
<p>
I have recently encountered a limitation of using synchronous bit-bang as a method to push JTAG patterns to FT2232H. 

The new patterns were much bigger. thankfully the pyftdi library had the necessary functions to help solve this issue. I am not too familiar with JTAG protocols, so had to do more trial and error with the JTAG functions to do what I needed it to do. 

I was controlling the FT2232H dongle via a LabVIEW program that calls a Python script. The new method was much faster than the bit-bang method.
