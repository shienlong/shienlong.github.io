<h2>PYTHON LIBRARY FOR FT2232H</h2>
<p>
There is an extremely useful Python library written by Emmanuel Blot <a href="https://github.com/eblot/pyftdi">[eblot]</a>.
Instead of writing your own C++ code to call the ftd2xx.dll, and if you are familiar with Python programming language, then just use <a href="https://eblot.github.io/pyftdi/">
PyFtdi</a> which is like a wrapper for the dll.
<p>
It works for other FTDI devices as well. 
The GitHub documentation is clear and quite easy to understand.
It does not officially support Windows. 
There is a USB driver that seems complicated to install but fortunately <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyftdiwin/">[Marius Greuel]</a> made PyFtdi much easier to use with Windows. 
It is basically a version of PyFtdi that works with Windows.

This blog site by <a href="https://iosoft.blog/2018/12/02/ftdi-python-part-1/">[iosoft]</a> that uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ftd2xx/">ftd2xx</a> Python package (another wrapper for FTDI dll).
