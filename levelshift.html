<h2>LEVEL SHIFTER - TXB0108</h2>
<p>
I have a 3.3V digital output coming from the <a href="ft2232h.html">DLP-2232H</a> and at the other end, the device either accepts 1.2V or 1.8V but not 3.3V.
The <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/txb0108.pdf">TXB0108</a> level shifter accepts a wide range of voltages and is bidirectional, meaning it can take a 3.3V signal and translate it to a lower voltage or the other way around depending on your application. 
<p>
It has 8-bits or 8 channels for your voltage translation. I only needed 4 but the additional pins are there should I need them for later expansion. 
There is a OE (Output Enable) pin which is supplied by VCCA, meaning if you want the outputs turned on, set it to VCCA, otherwise just drive it low. 
<p>
The VCCA and VCCB pins require a 0.1uF ceramic bypass capacitors. It is a pretty straightforward setup. 
A 50kOhm resistor is required if pull-up/pull-down is required. 
<p>
I tested it with a cheap sample from Shopee. Once I have determined it is working with my application on the breadboard, I purchased the parts from <a href="https://element14.com/">Element14</a>. 
<p>
I had drawn a schematic and layout using KiCAD. 
The available part package from Element14 was a WSON package type.
I had never hand soldered this package type before. 
However, it was not too difficult. 
It is possible to solder it using 1mm solder and 1mm bend conical tip. 
However, maybe a smaller, less than 1mm sized tip and solder wire would have worked better. 
I had several boards to solder, the heatgun method worked as well.
<p>
Update 26/08/2023 - 
One of the boards soldered using the heatgun method had a problematic pin. I had to touch up with solder every time there is an issue.
I suspect the problem to be the materials and methods I used.
I did not have fresh solder paste, so instead I added solder to the pads along with some flux.
Then placed the level shifter on the pads and used the heatgun to melt the solder. 
<p>
Another board soldered using 1mm solder tip did not have such issue. 
I might try again on a spare board if I have fresh solder paste. 
<p>
Another update is related to the VCCB voltage. 
Previously I tested a situation where VCCB is equal to VCCA and was still able to run my application. 
However, my application ran into issues after a few days of testing. 
My tests run for several hours, so it was quite a surprise that a new issue surfaced.
<p>
The level shifter seems to be drawing current from another supply. 
This issue disappeared once I increased the VCCB supply (relative to VCCA).
