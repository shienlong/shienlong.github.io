<h2>MEDICAL CARD IN MALAYSIA</h2>
<p>
NOTE: I am not an insurance agent. 
I do not claim to be an expert in insurance.
I am not endorsing any products. 
The information on this page is extracted from respective insurance company website.
However, it may have changed or may have inaccuracies because I did not check for mistakes.
This page is merely to share the features in different medical card products, side by side.
What you choose is up to you, hopefully this is helpful. 
<p>
Firstly, this is only a 'feature' comparison for medical cards put into a spreadsheet.
Medical card is a type of insurance which...in general...covers the cost of hospitalization. 
It means that if you have a need to be hospitalized, a medical card would then cover the costs of your hospitalization. 
<p>
The cost of a medical card increases with age. 
Usually by age (in blocks of 5 years), ie: age 40-45, 45-50 etc. 
You may have a insurance plan with medical card and you are paying a fixed premium. 
This does not mean that the cost of medical card does not increase each year. 
It may mean that your insurance is an "investment linked" plan whereby part of the premium you pay is put into a mutual fund and proceeds from that fund helps to offset the increased cost of
your medical card.
Unless stated clearly in your plan, your "fixed premium" could increase in the future. 
It increases because cost of hospitalization increases.
Similar to cost of goods and services. Inflation increases the cost of everything. 
<p> 
Medical cards can be stand-alone. 
You can purchase medical card plan yearly or renewed yearly. 
You can cancel anytime if its renewed yearly.
Riders are optional add-ons to insurance plan.
Medical cards can be a rider on your insurance plan.
This means that in your insurance plan, you have a "add-on option" aka "rider". 
<p>
I know...it maybe confusing. 
However, understanding the difference between medical cards and medical insurance (ie: with insurance plans that covers critical illness) could help us decide which product is suitable for us.
You have more options in personalizing your insurance coverage. 
<p>
Being a little more well-versed in the jargon and understanding what it means could help you ask better questions when meeting your insurance agent.
If you have insurance and would like to understand what coverage you have, by all means, contact your agent. 
It is part of their role to inform and educate customers on the insurance plan.
