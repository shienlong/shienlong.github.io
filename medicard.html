<h2>MEDICAL CARD IN MALAYSIA</h2>
<p>
DRAFT....DRAFT...DRAFT
<p>
NOTE: I am not an insurance agent. I do not claim to be an expert in insurance.
I am also not endorsing any brands. 
The information on this page is extracted from the insurance company website.
However, it may have changed or may have inaccuracies because I did not check for mistakes.
This page is merely to share the features in different medical card products. 
The main purpose is so the reader may have an idea of features and differences. 
What you choose is up to you, I just hope that having some way of viewing features side by side is helpful. 
<p>
Firstly, this is only a 'feature' comparison put in a spreadsheet for medical card.
Medical card is a type of insurance which...in general...provide coverage for cost of hospitalization. 
It means that if you have a need to be hospitalized, a medical card would then cover the costs of your hospitalization (based on what is covered). 
<p>
The cost of a medical card increases with age. Usually by age (in block), ie: 70-75 years old will be price X. 
You may have a insurance plan with medical card and you are paying a fixed premium. 
This does not mean that the medical card in your insurance plan is not increasing in cost. 
It may mean that your insurance is an "investment linked" plan whereby part of the premium you pay is put into a mutual fund and proceeds from that fund helps to offset the increased cost of
your medical card.
Unless stated clearly in your plan, it is likely that your fixed premium maybe increased. Especially when hospitalization costs increase beyond a certain point where the insurance company 
does not make a profit. Yes, insurance companies need to make profit in order to provide you the coverage.

If you have any doubts or need clarification, please go to the agent or company which you bought your plan from. 
I do not remember every detail of my plan.
I have to check from time to time, since the jargon is difficult to understand. 
<p>
Please be wary of biases from the people explaining the product to you. 
They may have a vested interest in getting you to buy the plan and therefore whatever claims or promises they make would need to be examined in detail.
They may well be selling a great product, but it is more important that you understand what is and is not in the plan and ultimately if it suits your personal circumstances. 
<p>
How to ask questions that mitigate biases?
