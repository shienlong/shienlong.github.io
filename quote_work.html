<h2>QUOTES FOR WORK</h2>
<p>
"Do not think that what is hard for you to master is humanly impossible;
<p>
and if it is humanly possible, consider it to be within your reach."
<p>
- Marcus Aurelius, Meditations
</p>
<p>
"Process saves us from the poverty of our intentions."
<p>
- Elizabeth King
</p>
<p>
"You have the right to work, but for the work's sake only.
You have no right to the fruits of work.
Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working.
Never give way to laziness, either.
<p>
Perform every action with your heart fixed on the Supreme Lord.
Renounce attachment to the fruits. 
Be even-tempered in success and failure:
for it is this evenness of temper which is meant by yoga.
<p>
Work done with anxiety about results is far inferior to work done without such anxiety,
in the calm of self-surrender.
Seek refuge in the knowledge of Brahma.
They who work selfishly for results are miserable."
<p>
- Bhagavad Gita

                alert('Thank you for subscribing!');

                // Optionally, you can log the emails to the console
                console.log(emailList);

Please note that the JavaScript array approach is suitable for small-scale applications, but for a more robust and secure solution, especially if you anticipate a large number of subscribers, using a database is recommended. Also, the JavaScript array approach won't persist across page reloads or if the user leaves the page. If you need persistence, you might consider using browser storage options like localStorage or sessionStorage.
