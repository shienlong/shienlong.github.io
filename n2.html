"Slow and steady wins the race." says Tortoise. 
<p>
There is always a timeline. Always someone asking when you will be finished with the report. So why do we tense up and stressed out? 
<p>
Probably social programming. Probably other things as well. 
<p>
Another question...can we do the opposite? Like, be chill. Heartbeat the same as it was before the question comes. 
<p>
Do we actually work better or faster when there is a timeline? I guess it depends on the person receiving our work. If they are good with it, then it could be better. So...no stress right, just work on it.
<p>
At the end of the day, was it worth it?
