<p>
It is more beneficial to be kind in our speech and thoughts in our daily interactions with the outside world. There maybe no rewards or repayment, we should not expect any. When we think and act with kindness, we gift the people around us an uplifting feeling. Which reflects and generates positive feelings all around. 
<p>
When we are resentful or angry in our speech and thoughts, although unintentional, it creates a heavy and forceful feeling. It might leave a mark when thrown against a wall. It may bounce back and hit us, dealing additional pain. Soon we will lose track and carry a heavy burden without clear understanding why or how it became that way. We might not realize that others may carry some of it as well when they are around us. 
<p>
What does it take to be kind and leave the surrounding net positive rather than net negative? Is it reflection of past self? Awareness of current self? Appreciation of nature?
<p>
Maybe it is all that and more. Maybe we need to ask these questions and more. Ask it everyday. Contemplate and revisit the past. Make peace with our past self, to give 'now' a chance. Don't give up, make the day the best of our efforts and start again tomorrow. Slowly see ourselves clearly, understand ourselves deeply and then keep what we like.
