<h1><a href="index.html">SHIEN LONG</a></h1>
<hr>
<p>
Old uncomfortable emotions resurface. Arrogance, disappointment, fear. Old bad behaviours resurface. Comparing with others, then feeling subpar or insufficient. 
<p>
It takes so much time and energy away from me. It evokes in me images of the past and dream for the future. Gotta refocus. Gotta clear my mind, every ounce of good clean energy to focus on the NOW. There will be nothing for the future if I don't work/create/produce/hustle NOW. There will a past to regret if I don't be here and feel NOW.
